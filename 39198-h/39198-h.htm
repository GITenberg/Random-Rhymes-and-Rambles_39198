4</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><i>The RANDOM RHYMES and RAMBLES</i>, <i>in verse and
prose</i>, <i>are but the leisure musings of the uneducated</i>,
<i>and cannot be expected to come up to anything like the
standard of even poetry</i>; <i>yet</i>, <i>when the fact is
known that the Author</i>, <i>like his Works</i>, <i>are rough
and ready</i>, <i>without the slightest notion of either
Parnassus or the Nines</i>, <i>at least give him credit for what
they are worth</i>.</p>

At barns mud nivver be like him;<br />

An the maiden with her flagon,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Gives a grandeur to the charm;<br />
And the clover and the haycock<br />

When tewit an the moorgame,<br />

<p>[Having spent the whole of the afternoon in this romantic
little glen, indulging in pleasant meditations, I began to wend
my way down the craggy pass that leads to the bonny little hamlet
of Goose Eye, and turning round to take a last glance at this
enchanting vale&mdash;with its running wimpling stream&mdash;I
beheld the &ldquo;Lass o&rsquo; Newsholme Dean.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
was engaged in driving home a Cochin China hen and her
chickens.&nbsp; Instantaneously I was seized with a poetic fit,
and gazing upon her as did Robert Tannyhill upon his imaginary
beauty, &ldquo;The Flower of Dumblane.&rdquo;&nbsp; I struck my

be a respectable old woman of 70 winters, yet there is still a

<h2>The Broken Pitcher.</h2>
<p>[The happiest moments of a soldier in time of peace is when
sat round the hearth of his neat little barrack room, along with
his comrades, spinning yarns and telling tales; sometimes giving
the history of some famous battle or engagement in which he took
a prominent part, othertimes he will relate his own love
adventures; then the favourite of the room will oblige them with
his song of &ldquo;Nelson&rdquo; or &ldquo;Napoleon,&rdquo;
generally being the favourite with them;&mdash;then there is the
fancy tale teller which amuses all.&nbsp; But in all cases the
teller of a tale, yarn or story makes himself the hero of it, and
especially when he speaks of the lass he left behind him; hence
his adventure with the Lassie by the Well.&rdquo;]</p>

Or wherefore does that pitcher lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Broken by thy side?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;My pitcher is broken, sir,<br />

Can I forget the songs sung by my sire,<br />
Like some prophetic bard tuning the lyre?<br />
Sweet were the notes that he taught to the young;<br />
Psalms for the Sabbath on Sabbath were sung;<br />
And the young minstrels enraptured would come<br />
To the lone cottage I once called my home.</p>

I&rsquo;m waiting of shuttles that he should have won:<br />
She in that cottage there knitting her healds,<br />
While I her young forester was roaming the fields.</p>
<p class="poetry">But the shades of the evening gather slowly
around,<br />
The twilight it thickens and darkens the ground,<br />

To take one fond look, one last fond adieu;<br />
By night&rsquo;s envious hand thou art snatched from my view,<br

But O, there&rsquo;s no darkness, to me no decay;<br />
Home of my boyhood, can chase thee away.</p>

<h2>The Heroic Watchman of Calversike Hill.</h2>
<p>[This extraordinary &ldquo;hero&rdquo; either bore false
witness against his neighbour, a poor artisan, or (taking his own
word for it) saved the nation from great disaster and ruin by
putting out a fire that no one saw but himself.]</p>
<p class="poetry">We&rsquo;ve heard of great fires in city and
town,<br />
And many disasters by fire are known;<br />
But surely this fire which I&rsquo;m going to tell,<br />
Was worse than Mount &AElig;tna, Vesuvius or hell;<br />
For the great prophesy it no doubt would fulfill,<br />
But for <i>heroic</i> watchman at Calversike Hill.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>This fire it broke out in the night it was said,<br />
While peacefully each villager slept in his bed;<br />
And so greatly the flames did illumne all the skies,<br />
That it took the big watchman all in surprise.<br />
Yet great was the courage and undaunted skill<br />
Of the <i>heroic</i> watchman of Calversike Hill.</p>
<p class="poetry">He swore by his Maker, the flames rose so
high,<br />
That within a few yards, sir, it reached to the sky;<br />
And so greatly it lighted up mountains and dales,<br />
He could see into Ireland, Scotland and Wales!<br />
And so easily the commons did swallow his pill,<br />
That they fin&rsquo;d the poor artist of Calversike Hill.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, there&rsquo;s some foolish people are led
to suppose,<br />
It was by some shavings this fire first arose;<br />
But yet, says our &ldquo;hero,&rdquo; I greatly suspect,<br />
This fire was caused by the grossest neglect.<br />
But I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s put out, let it be as it will,<br
/>
Says the <i>heroic</i> watchman of Calversike Hill.</p>
<p class="poetry">He needed no witness to swear what he had
done,<br />
Yet if he had wanted he could have had one;<br />
For one Tommy Twister, that never was there,<br />
Saw the sparks from the chimney, as they flew in the air,<br />
The greatest sized coal pot no doubt they would fill,<br />
Like the head of the <i>hero</i> of Calversike Hill.</p>
<p class="poetry">So many brave thanks to this <i>heroic</i>
knave,<br />
For thousands of lives no doubt he did save,<br />
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>And but
for this hero disaster had spread,<br />
And smothered the nation while sleeping in bed;<br />
But to save all his people it was the Lord&rsquo;s will,<br />
Through the <i>heroic</i> watchman at Calversike Hill.</p>
<p class="poetry">So mind and be careful and put out your
lights,<br />
All ye with red noses in case they ignite,<br />
Or perhaps from your bed you may have to leap,<br />
In case this great watchman chances to sleep.<br />
For as rumours are spread, he is fond of his gill,<br />
Is the <i>heroic</i> watchman of Calversike Hill.</p>

<p class="poetry">High o&rsquo;er the hill-tops moans the wild
breezes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As from the dark branches I hear the sad strain:<br
/>
See the lean pauper by his grim hearth he freezes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While comfort and plenty in palaces reign.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dark is the visage of the rugged old ocean,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the caves in the billow he rides his foamed
steed:<br />
As over the grim surges with his chariot in motion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He spreads desolation, and laughs at the deed.</p>
<p class="poetry">No more with the tempest the river is
swelling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No angry clouds frown, nor sky darkly lower;<br />
The bee sounds her horn, and the gay news is telling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That spring is established with sunshine and
showers.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the pride of its beauty the young year is
shining,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And nature with blossom is wreathing the trees;<br

The white and the green in rich clusters entwining,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sprinkling their sweetness on the wings of the
breeze.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; While diamond dew-drops around her is spread;<br />
She smiles thro&rsquo; her tears like an infant that&rsquo;s
sleeping,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to laughter is changed as her sorrows are
fled.</p>
<p class="poetry">The landscape around is now sprinkled with
flowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mountains are blue in their distant array;<br />
The wreaths of green leaves are refreshed with the showers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a moth in the sunshine the lark flees away.</p>
<p class="poetry">How joyous the reapers, their harvest songs
singing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As they see the maid bringing the flagon and
horn;<br />
And the goddess of plenty benedictions is flinging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over meadows and pastures, and her barley and
corn.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis sweet on the hills with the morning
sun shining,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To watch the rich vale as it brightens below;<br />

&ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; says oud Jennet, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s

t&rsquo; city is situated in a very romantic part o&rsquo;
Yorkshur, and within two or three miles o&rsquo;t boundary mark
o&rsquo; Lancashire.&nbsp; Some foak sez it wer t&rsquo;last
place at wer made, but it&rsquo;s a mistak, for it lukes oud
fashun&rsquo;d enuff to be t&rsquo;first &rsquo;at wer
made.&nbsp; Gert travellers sez it resembles t&rsquo; cities
o&rsquo; Rome and Edinburgh, fer ther&rsquo;s a deal o&rsquo;
up-hills afore you can get to&rsquo;t top on&rsquo;t; but e
landing you&rsquo;d be struck wi&rsquo; wonder and
amazement&mdash;what wi&rsquo;t tall biggens, monniments, <a

hampitheaters, and so on; fer instance, t&rsquo;Church, or rather
the Cathedral, is a famous biggen, and stands majestically
o&rsquo;t top at hill.&nbsp; It hes been sed at Oliver Cromwell
that wor so struck wi&rsquo;t appearance at Church an t&rsquo;
City, altogether, wal he a mack a consented to hev it the
hed-quarters for the army and navy.</p>
<p>The faander o&rsquo; t&rsquo; Church is sed to be won
Wang-be-Wang, won et Empror&rsquo;s o&rsquo; China as com ower in

granmuther; the natives at that toime wur a mack a wild, but i
mixing up we t&rsquo; balloonites they soin become civilized and
big&rsquo;d t&rsquo; Church at&rsquo;s studden fra that time to
nah, wit exepshun o&rsquo; won end, destroyed at sum toime, sum
sez it wur be war.&nbsp; Sum sez west and an t&rsquo; saath end
wur destroyed, but it&rsquo;s a mack a settled on wit wiseuns it
wur wichcraft; but be it as it may Haworth, an&rsquo; t&rsquo;
folk a&rsquo;tagether is as toff as paps, an&rsquo; hez stud aht
weel, an&rsquo; no daht but it wod a flerished before Lunden,
Parriss, or Jerusulum, for sentries back, if they&rsquo;d hed a
Railway; but after nearly all Grate Britten and France hed been
furnished we a Railway, the people i Haworth began to be uneazy
and felt inclined no longer to wauk several miles to get to a
stashun if they were bahn off liks.&nbsp; And besides, they thout
it wur high time to begin and mack sum progress i&rsquo; t&rsquo;
wurld, like their naburs &rsquo;t valley.&nbsp; So they adjetated
for a line down the valley as far as Keighley, and after abaht <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>a hundred
meetings they gat an Act passed for it i Parlement.&nbsp; So at
last a Cummittee wur formed, and they met wun neet a purpose to
decide when it wod be t&rsquo; best convenient for em to dig
t&rsquo; furst sod to commerate and start the gert event.&nbsp;
And a bonny rumpus there wor yo mind, for yo may think ha it wor
conducted when they wur threapin wi wun another like a lot
o&rsquo; oud wimen at a parish pump when it sud be.&nbsp; Wun sed
it mud tak place at rushberring, another sed next muck-spreading
toime, a third sed it mud be dug et gert wind-day e memory
o&rsquo; oud Jack K&mdash;.&nbsp; Well, noan et proposishuns wod
do for t&rsquo; lot, and there wur such opposistion wal it omust
hung on a threed, wether the railway went on or net, wal at last
an oud farmer, wun o&rsquo; the committee-men, we a voice as
hoarse as a farm yard dog, bawls aht, I propose Pancake
Tuesday.&nbsp; So after a little more noise it wor proposed and
seconded at the Grand Trunk Railway between the respective tahns
of Keighley and Haworth sud be commemorated wi diggin t&rsquo;
furst sod o&rsquo; Pancake Tuesday, it year o&rsquo; our Lord
1864; and be t&rsquo; show o&rsquo; hands it usual way it wor
carried by wun, and that wor Ginger Jabus, and t&rsquo;tother cud
a liked t&rsquo;bowt him ower, but Jabus worn&rsquo;t to be bowt
that time, for he hed his hart and sowl i the movement, and he
went abaht singin&mdash;</p>

where the ceremuny wur to tak place the processhun halted and
formed itseln into a raand ring, and cheers wur geen wi shakin
hats and handkerchiefs, which lasted wal their showders and arms
warkt wal they&rsquo;d hardly strength to shut their maaths and
don their hats on.&nbsp; But hasumivver they manijed to get
reight agean, and then a parson called Ned Oufield gat up and
made the following narashun&mdash;</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen and citizens o&rsquo; Haworth,&mdash;It
gives me gert plezur to see such a gert event as this tak place i
the city o&rsquo; Haworth, namely, digging t&rsquo; <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>furst sod
o&rsquo; wat&rsquo;s called Grand Trunk Line between Keighley and
yor native element, and reight pleased I am to offishiate as
chairman on this occashun.&nbsp; Perhaps sum on yo maint naw what
I mean wi yer native element; but I mean yer oud mountain side,
and aw naw yor like yer forefathers, yo love it dearly,
tho&rsquo; yor ancestors wor nowt but barbarians in the fourth
and fifth sentries, yet they were the furst to embrace
Christianity, which they did it yer 600, be the Latin inscripshun
on the church steeple.&mdash;(Loud cheers).&mdash;And although yo
been behind we yor Railway, ye been up i different arts and
sciences.&nbsp; Wat nashun, my frends, can boast of a majishun
like yor oud Jack K&mdash;.&mdash;(Loud cheers).&nbsp; He wur a
credit to yo all, and yo wur sadly indebted to him; he proffesied
twenty yer sin at this event wud cum to pass (a voice,&mdash;ha
wish he wur alive he sud be contractor), and if he&rsquo;d been
livin to this day, its a hundred to wun but the Railway wud hev
been made to some where else ner Keighley, for ha feel convinced
et Keighley is not worthy of amalgamashun wi a respectable city
like Haworth.&mdash;(Hear, hear.)&nbsp; For look wat insultin
langwidj they&rsquo;ve used to yo at different
times.&mdash;(Groans.)&nbsp; Furst, they said yo muckt church to
mak it grow bigger.&nbsp; Then yo walked rahnd tahn&rsquo;s post
office at Keighley and thout it wur the cemetery, and to make up
for the lot, they call us wild craturs and mock wur plezant
dialect, which is better English ner theirs.&mdash;(Groans, wich
lasted for ten minits.)&nbsp; Yes, my fella citizens,
you&rsquo;ve <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>hed to put up wi a deal o&rsquo; slang fra theas
uncultivated rascals.&mdash;(We have.)&nbsp; And wat&rsquo;s war
nur all, yah&rsquo;ve hed to wauk wet and dry, thro thick and
thin, i all sorts o&rsquo; weather to Keighley, wen you&rsquo;ve
wanted to go on the continent or Lundun.&nbsp; But soin yo can
wauk slap to the train in a jiffey.&mdash;(Loud cheers.)&nbsp;
Mr. Oufield then thenkt his fella taansmen and wimen and ended
his speech wi expressin his delight in the loyalty of the people
for the railway, and as the time was fast waxin, he begged leave
to sit dahn, wich he did t&rsquo; midst lahd enthusiastic
shouting.</p>
<p>This been dun and ivverybody gotten their maaths shut agean,
Ike Ouden gat up and made a speech, and a grand un it wor yo
mind, for if the arkangel hed dropt streyt dahn fra heven and let
o&rsquo; t&rsquo;top o&rsquo; t&rsquo;platform, it cuddant a
suited t&rsquo; folk better, for he began as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Fella-citizens and tahnsmen o&rsquo; Haworth,&mdash;Wen I see
before me so many smiling faces and so many distingwisht
citizens, I awn ha felt a pang as to my unfitness for appearing
afore yo on this occashun; but yor committee wor so urgent in
their appeal to me that I wor certainly induced to akcept the
honnor of diggin the furst sod o&rsquo; the Grand Trunk Railway,
wich will be the gratest blessin that ivver will be i
Haworth.&nbsp; But yet its not for me to say wat is kalkulated or
unkalkulated for the people o&rsquo; Haworth to do in the 19th
sentry, yet I may ventur to say at this glorious muvment nah bahn
to tak place will <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>shortly prove the gratest blessin ivver witnessed it
city o&rsquo; Haworth.&mdash;(Loud applause).&nbsp; Look at the
export and import of the city, and compare the spaven&rsquo;d
horse and cart wi the puffin willyams and all the fine
carriages.&nbsp; Look et difference between wen it tuk a week to
go to Liverpool, and a month to Lundun, in a oud coach, and hev
to mak wur wills afore we went.&mdash;(Enthusiastic
cheering.)&nbsp; Yes, my frends, we stud good chance e being
robbed and plundered if net summat war.&nbsp; Besides wat an
immense diffrence it will mak to Haworth, wen shoo can export her
own mannifacturs to all the civilised and uncivilised wurld, and
by means o&rsquo; steam find their ways into rejuns nivver trod
but by feet o&rsquo; wild craturs and beasts o&rsquo; prey.&nbsp;
But to mak t&rsquo; story short ha mean to say it will be a grate
cumfort and a blessin to both the lame and lazey, and speshally
to the latter.&nbsp; But as the time was gettin on fastish, as it
allus dus when there&rsquo;s out to be dun, so Mr. Ouden finisht
his speech as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Put yor shoulders to work, lads, and
ne&rsquo;er be danted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Think yer behint and there&rsquo;s no time to
dally,<br />
For nah is the time yor assistance is wanted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I makin yor railway along the Worth Valley.</p>
<p>The Spring-heead Band then played sum of their favorite tunes,
&ldquo;Oud Rosen the Bow,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jessey&rsquo;s
Pig,&rdquo; and ended wi &ldquo;God save the Queen,&rdquo; and
all departed to their homes wi smiling faces.</p>

What mischief it wur bahn ta brew.<br />
And news he spred abaht the tahn,<br />
What lots o&rsquo; rain wud tumble dahn;<br />
And like his anshent sires he spoke,<br />
The shockin news withaht a joke.</p>
<p class="poetry">For soin the rain i torrents fell,<br />
And O what awful news to tell,<br />
It lookt as th clahds wur bahn to shutter,<br />
For every dyke, and ditch, and gutter,<br />
A reguler deluge did resemble,<br />

made Haworth folk to tremble.<br />
Some tried to stop its course wi&rsquo; stones,<br />
And some dropt on their marrow bones,<br />

The railway wud be safe an&rsquo; sahnd;</p>

For th&rsquo; waters deluged all the dale;<br />

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Work boys, work, and be
contented.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ha, its all varry weel for the poit to sing that, but if he
hed a railway at stake he wud happen alter his tune, an
espeshully if he wur an eye-witness nah, for th&rsquo; storm wur
ragin at heyest, and the folks wur waiting wi&rsquo; pashent
expectashun to knaw whether they wur bahn to be at an end or not,
for th&rsquo; flooid wur coming dahn thicker an&rsquo; faster,
and there look&rsquo;d to be monny a hundred mile o&rsquo; watter
in the valley.&nbsp; Hasumivver they muster&rsquo;d all t&rsquo;
energy they cud, for they wur determined to knaw th&rsquo; warst,
so they went to see if they could find th&rsquo; oud weather
gazer at hed <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>proffesied th&rsquo; flooid; and after a good deal
o&rsquo; runnin abaht, they fan him peepin thru summat at shap of
a tunnel.&nbsp; Sum sed he wur lookin at th&rsquo; mooin, others
sed he wor looking into futurity, hasumivver they asked him to
come dahn an&rsquo; look at the railway, and tell em whether
th&rsquo; flooid wur bahn to tak it away or not, but th&rsquo;
saucy oud hound refused at first, for he said at he wur flaid at
sum on em wodn&rsquo;t be able to stand th&rsquo; shock if he
tell&rsquo;d em th&rsquo; warst, so th&rsquo; oud lad sed</p>
<p class="poetry">If my advice yoh want, poor things,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An cannut do withaht it,<br />
Go arm yor seln to th&rsquo; teeth, he sed,<br />

Both rakes an&rsquo; powls an&rsquo; props an&rsquo; ropes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yo cannot get ta sooin,<br />
An&rsquo; take the Cowinheeader&rsquo;s plan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When they discuver&rsquo;d the mooin,<br />
Doant gape abaht, but when yor arm&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take each a diffrent rowt;<br />
And let yor cry be ivvery man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Th&rsquo; poor railway&rsquo;s up the spout.</p>
<p>It wurnt long afore they gat arm&rsquo;d&mdash;sum wi clothes
props, muk forks, ropes, and so on, and there wor some
competition yo mind, for they wur all trying which could mak best
movement so as they could immortalise their names it history of
Haworth, for there wur one Joe Hobb, a handloom weaver, browt his
slay boards, and as he wor going dahn th&rsquo; hill he did mak
some man&oelig;vures, an&rsquo; talk abaht fugal men it <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>army when
they throw their guns up into th&rsquo; air and catches em again,
they wur nowt to Joe, for he span his slay boards up an&rsquo;
dahn just like a shuttlecock.&nbsp; But wal all this wur going on
the storm began to abate, and th&rsquo; water seem&rsquo;d to get
less, but still they kept at it.&nbsp; Wal at last a chap at they
call Dave Twirler shahted aht he saw summat, and they
look&rsquo;t way at he pointed, and there behold it wur won
o&rsquo;th&rsquo; ribs o&rsquo;th&rsquo; railway sticking up
(here a dead silence tuk place which lasted for abaht three
hours) for nobody durst open their mahths, flaid
a&rsquo;th&rsquo; wind wud mak th&rsquo; current stronger, and
sum at wimen held their tungs to that pain and misery wal their
stockings fell dahn ower their clog tops; but hasumever th&rsquo;
silence wur broken by a Haworth Parish chap at they call Bob
Gimlet, he happened to be there and he said nah lads, look down
th&rsquo; valley for I think I see th&rsquo; skeleton at onny
rate, and Bob wur reight for it wur as plain to be seen as an
elephant in a shop window.</p>
<p class="poetry">And this wur a fact this wur th&rsquo; railway
they saw,<br />
And at th&rsquo; first sight o&rsquo; th&rsquo; spectre they all
stood in awe,<br />
For it wur smashed all i&rsquo; pieces ashamed to be seen<br />
As tho&rsquo; it hed passed thro&rsquo; a sausidge masheen;<br />
Wi horror some fainted, while others took fits,<br />
Aud these at cud stand it wur piking up t&rsquo;bits.</p>
<p class="poetry">But after a while when they all becum calm,<br

<a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>They
gathered together like bees in a swarm,<br />
Resolvd to pick up all fragments and th&rsquo; wood,<br />
And splice &rsquo;em together as weel as they cud,<br />
Hasumever thay started a putting it streyt,<br />
And wi&rsquo; spelking and braying they soon made it reight.</p>
<p class="poetry">Six months nah elapsed and th&rsquo; gert job
wur done,<br />
And th&rsquo; next thing to argue wur wen it sud run,<br />
So they sent Joe a-Stirks arahnd wi&rsquo; his bell,<br />
And gave him strict orders at he wur to tell,<br />
At th&rsquo; inspector hed been and examined it thro&rsquo;,<br
/>
And cum to th&rsquo; conclushun et th&rsquo; railway wud do.</p>
<p class="poetry">So to wark wi a vengance, the bellman set
to,<br />
To warn up a meeting to meet a&rsquo;th&rsquo; Black Bull,<br />
It wud dun yo all good to hear Joey shaht,<br />
For they heard him distinctly for miles all abaht,<br />
And i&rsquo; less ner ten minits, they flockt in so fast,<br />
While Jonny Broth horses they couldn&rsquo;t get past.</p>
<p class="poetry">So they fram&rsquo;d on wi&rsquo; th&rsquo;
meeting an&rsquo; th&rsquo; chairman spak first,<br />
And tell&rsquo;d &rsquo;em at th&rsquo; railway wur
finish&rsquo;d at last;<br />
And declared at th&rsquo; inspector hed passed when he com,<br />
Both viaducts and bridges as sahnd as a plum;<br />
As for sinkin agean they wud do nowt et sort,<br />
For they sailed thro&rsquo; the arches i&rsquo; Marriner&rsquo;s

<p class="poetry"><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

And settle when th&rsquo; oppening o&rsquo; th&rsquo; railway sud

He thout for his part tho&rsquo; he nobbut wur won,<br />
At first day o&rsquo; April wur fittest to run,<br />
Wen a voice sed, sit dahn or I&rsquo;ll pelt thee wi&rsquo;

<p class="poetry">Then up on to th&rsquo; platform jump&rsquo;d
Red Dicky Brook,<br />
Along wi&rsquo; his uncle Black Tom at Dyke Nook,<br />
Determined to sattle and bring things arahnd,<br />
As th&rsquo; railway wur finished both proper and sahnd;<br />
So they pitched on a day&mdash;this wur April the fourth.<br />
To oppen th&rsquo; grand railway fra Lunden to Haworth.</p>
<p class="poetry">It wur carried as usual, bi&rsquo; th&rsquo;
showing o&rsquo; hands,<br />
Amidst grate rejoicing and playing o&rsquo; bands,<br />
Both oud men and wimen hed a smile on their face,<br />
For all wur dead certain this wur bahn to tak place,<br />
So they fled to their homes like bees to a hive,<br />
Impashent and anshus for th&rsquo; day to arrive.</p>

And little they thout when they set off that morn,<br />

For Joe Stirk wur sent out to tell &rsquo;em to stop,<br />
For poor Haworth Railway hed gotten i&rsquo; pop.</p>

<p class="poetry">Good folks you&rsquo;ve inkwired at home

And I&rsquo;ve tain up my pen for ill yo&rsquo;d a taint,<br />
If I hednt a geen yo a truthful ackahnt.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hasumivver this morning, as I tell&rsquo;d yo

I wur wakken&rsquo;d wi hearin a awful uproar,<br />

o&rsquo;th&rsquo; folk,<br />
And the bells at wur ringin, they wur past onny joke,<br />
For ivvery two minnits they shahted hurrah,<br />
We are nah bahn to oppen the Haworth Railway.</p>
<p class="poetry">So I jump&rsquo;d up i&rsquo; bed, an&rsquo; I
gat on the floor,<br />
I slipt on my cloas and ran out at door,<br />
And the first at I met, it wur one Jimmy Peg,<br />
He cum&rsquo;d up fra Bocking and brout a gert flag,<br />
And just at his heels wur the Spring-headed band,<br />
Playing a march&mdash;I thout it wur grand.</p>
<p class="poetry">So I fell into the step for I knaw how to
march,<br />
For I&rsquo;ve been stiffen&rsquo;d up wi&rsquo; guvernment

And first smell o&rsquo; music it maks me fair dance,<br />
And I prick up my ears like a trooper his lance,<br />
Hasumivver, I thout as I&rsquo;d gotten i&rsquo; th&rsquo;

wur a&rsquo; th&rsquo; stashun where the train hed to land;<br />
There wur flags of all nashuns fra the Union Jack<br />

For the Inspector and conductor and all sorts o&rsquo; fray<br />
Wur expected directly to land at the railway.</p>
<p class="poetry">So I star&rsquo;d wal both een wur varry near

And waited and waited&mdash;at last it appear&rsquo;d,<br />
It wur filled full o&rsquo; folk as eggs full o&rsquo; meat,<br

And it tuk four ingens to bring it up reight,<br />
Two hed long chimlas and th&rsquo; tuther hed noan,<br />
But they stuck weel together like a dog to a bone.</p>
<p class="poetry">They wur gruntin and growling wur the folks at

So I made some inquiries what it wur abaht;<br />
And i&rsquo; all my born days I ne&rsquo;er heard nout so

For three or four times they sed it hed stall&rsquo;d,<br />
Wal some o&rsquo;th&rsquo; crookt-legg&rsquo;d ens bethout of a

And they went back to Keighley for a hamper o&rsquo;steam.</p>
<p class="poetry">And my word and honour it did mak a gert

For I stud by and heard it, and saw it come in;<br />
I expected it coming as quiet as a lamb,<br />
But no daht at the noises wur nobbut a sham;<br />
But what&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; telling yo ha it did come,<br

I&rsquo;d forgotten yo&rsquo;d ridden to Wibsey begum.</p>

<p class="poetry">In a little cot so dreary,<br />
With eyes and forehead hot and bleary,<br />
Sat a mother sad and weary,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With her darling on her knee;<br

Their humble fare at best was sparing,<br />
For the father he was shearing,<br />
With his three brave sons o&rsquo; Erin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down in the Fen country.</p>
<p class="poetry">All her Saxon neighbours leave her,<br />
With her boy and demon fever,<br />
The midnight watch&mdash;none to relieve her,<br />

Noisy as a drum clock laram,<br />
Yet his treasures he would share &rsquo;em,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his friend right merrily.</p>
<p class="poetry">Every night and every morning,<br />
With the day sometimes at dawning,<br />
While the mother, sick and swooning,<br />

Robbing his good Saxon mother,<br />
Giving to his Celtic brother,<br />
Who asked&mdash;for him and no other,<br />

Sabbath morning he was ready,<br />
Warn&rsquo;d the bearers to be steady,<br />
Taking Peter to his Biddy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a tear stood in his

<p class="poetry">Onward as the corpse was passing,<br />

How is this that here we meet her?<br />
And without our little Peter,<br />

<p class="poetry">The Aram-Skaram interfered,<br />
Soon this corpse will be interred,<br />
Come with us and see it burried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out in yonder cemetery:<br />
Soon they knew the worst, and pondered<br />
Half-amazed and half-dumbfounded;&mdash;<br />
And returning home, they wondered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who their little friend could

<h2><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>Dame
Europe&rsquo;s Lodging House.</h2>
<p class="poetry">Dame Europa kept a Lodging House,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she was fond of brass;<br />
She took in public lodgers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of every rank and class.</p>
<p class="poetry">She&rsquo;d French and Germans, Dutch and
Swiss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And other nations too;<br />
So poor old Mrs. Europe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had plenty work to do.</p>
<p class="poetry">I cannot just now name her beds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her number being so large;<br />
But five she kept for deputies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which she had in her charge.</p>
<p class="poetry">So in this famous Lodging house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; John Bull he stood A ONE,<br />
On whom she always kept an eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see things rightly done.</p>
<p class="poetry">And Master Louis was her next,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And second, there&rsquo;s no doubt,<br />
For when a little row took place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He always backed John out.</p>
<p class="poetry">For in her house was Alex Russ,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oft him they ey&rsquo;d with fear;<br />
<a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>For Alex
was a lazy hound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kept a Russian Bear.</p>
<p class="poetry">Her fourth was a man of grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And was for heaven bent;<br />
His name was Pious William,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Guided by his testament.</p>
<p class="poetry">Her fifth, too, was a pious Knave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis our firm belief,<br />
He once did rob the Hungary Lads<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of their honest bread and beef.</p>
<p class="poetry">These were Dame Europe&rsquo;s deputies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In whom she put her trust,<br />
To keep her lodging house at peace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In case eruption burst.</p>
<p class="poetry">For many a time a row took place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While sharing out the scran;<br />
But John and Louis soon stepp&rsquo;d in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cleared the <i>padding can</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">Once Alex Russ&rsquo;s father Nick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A bit before he died,<br />
Seized a little Turk one day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thought to warm his hide.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>But John and Louis soon stepp&rsquo;d in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Declaring it foul play;<br />
And made old Nick remember it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Until his dying day.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now all Dame Europe&rsquo;s deputies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They made themselves at home;<br />
And every lodger knew his bed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise his sitting room.</p>
<p class="poetry">They took great interest in their beds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kept them very clean;<br />
Unlike some other padding cans,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So dirty and so mean.</p>
<p class="poetry">But Louis had the nicest bed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of any of the lot;<br />
And being close by a window,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He loved a flower pot.</p>
<p class="poetry">The best and choicest bed of all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was occupied with Johnny;<br />
Because the Dame did favour him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He did collect her money.</p>
<p class="poetry">And in a little bunk he lived,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seal&rsquo;d up with oak, and tarr&rsquo;d;<br />
He would not let a single one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come near within a yard.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>A Jack of all trades, too, was John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And aught he&rsquo;d do for brass;<br />
And what he ever took in hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No one could him surpass.</p>
<p class="poetry">When tired of being shut up it bunk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes he went across,<br />
To spend an hour with Master Louis,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they the wine would toss.</p>
<p class="poetry">So many a happy day they spent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These lads, with one another;<br />
While every lodger in the house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thought John was Louis&rsquo; brother.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Dame allowed John something nice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To get well in her rent,<br />
Which every now and then it bank,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He put it on per cent.</p>
<p class="poetry">And working very hard himself<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amongst his tar and pitch;<br />
He soon accumulated wealth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That made him very rich.</p>
<p class="poetry">The next to Louis&rsquo; bed was Will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The biggest Monitor;<br />
And though he did pretend a saint,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was as big a cur.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>He loved to make them all believe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was opposed to strife,<br />
And said he never caused a row,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No, never in his life.</p>
<p class="poetry">He was so fond of singing psalms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And read his testament;<br />
So everybody was deceived<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was on mischief bent.</p>
<p class="poetry">He seldom passed a lodger&rsquo;s bed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But what he took a glance,<br />
Which made them every one suspect<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;d rob them if he&rsquo;d chance.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now Louis had two flower pots<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He nourished with much care,<br />
But little knew that Willie&rsquo;s eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were set upon the pair.</p>
<p class="poetry">In one there grew an <span
class="smcap">Alsace</span> Rose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The other a <span class="smcap">Loraine</span>,<br
/>
And Willie vowed they once were his<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And must be his again.</p>
<p class="poetry">He said his father once lodg&rsquo;d there,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that the dame did know<br />
That Louis predecessors once<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had sneaked them in a row.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>But in Willie&rsquo;s council was a lad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to every quirk,<br />
To keep him out of mischief, long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dame Europe had her work.</p>
<p class="poetry">To this smart youth Saint Willie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did whisper his desire<br />
One night as they sat smoking,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the kitchen fire.</p>
<p class="poetry">To get them flowers back again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Bissy, very low,<br />
Meet Louis somewhere on the quiet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And try to cause a row.</p>
<p class="poetry">But mind the other deputies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t catch you on the hop,<br />
For John and Joseph you must know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your little game would stop.</p>
<p class="poetry">For Joseph he has not forgot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The day you warmed his rig;<br />
And christian Denmark still thinks on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About his nice Slesvig.</p>
<p class="poetry">By your advice, my own Dear Mark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been guided on,<br />
But what about that man i&rsquo;t bunk?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pointing o&rsquo;er to John.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>He&rsquo;s very plucky too is John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But yet he&rsquo;s very slow,<br />
And perhaps he never may perceive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our scheme about the row.</p>
<p class="poetry">But not another word of this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To anybody&rsquo;s ears,<br />
The dame she plays the list&rsquo;ner,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have my doubts and fears.</p>
<p class="poetry">So let us go up-stairs at once,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it will be best,<br />
And let us pray to Him above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we go to rest.</p>
<p class="poetry">So with a pious countenance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His prayers as usual said,<br />
But squinting round the room the while,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He spied an empty bed.</p>
<p class="poetry">What a pity that these empty stocks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should be unoccupied;<br />
Do you think my little cousin, Mark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To them could be denied.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis just the very thing, said Mark,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your cousin, sir, and you,<br />
Would carry out my scheme first-rate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One at each side of Lue.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>The dame being asked did not object<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If he could pay the rent,<br />
And had a decent characterz<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Louis would consent.</p>
<p class="poetry">But I do object to this says Lue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on this very ground,<br />
Willy and his cousins, ma&rsquo;am,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They soon will me surround.</p>
<p class="poetry">They&rsquo;re nothing in my line at all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They are so near a-kin,<br />
And so if I consent to this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At once they&rsquo;ll hem me in.</p>
<p class="poetry">O, you couldn&rsquo;t think it, Master Lue,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I should do you harm,<br />
For don&rsquo;t I read my testament<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t I sing my psalm.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis all my eye, said Louis, both<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your testament and psalms;<br />
You use the dumbbells regular<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To strengthen up your arms.</p>
<p class="poetry">So take your poor relation off,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You pious-looking prig,<br />
And open out Kit Denmark&rsquo;s box,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And give him back Slesvig.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>Come, come, says Mrs. Europe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s have no bother here,<br />
Your trying now to breed a row<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At least it does appear.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now Johnny hearing from the bunk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What both of them did say,<br />
He shouted out, Now stop it, Will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or else you&rsquo;ll rue the day.</p>
<p class="poetry">All right friend John, I&rsquo;m much
obliged,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You are my friend, I know,<br />
And so my little cousin, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m willing to withdraw.</p>
<p class="poetry">But Louis frothed at mouth with rage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like one that was insane,<br />
And said he&rsquo;d make Bill promise him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;d not offend again.</p>
<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;d promise no such thing, says Mark,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For that would hurt your pride,<br />
Sing on and read your testament,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dame Europe&rsquo;s on your side.</p>
<p class="poetry">If I&rsquo;d to promise out at sort,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be against my mind;<br />
So take it right or take it wrong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll promise naught at kind.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>Then I shall take and wallop thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless thou cuts thy stick,<br />
And drive thee to thy fatherland<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before another week.</p>
<p class="poetry">Come on, cried Sanctimonius,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sending out his arm<br />
He caught poor Louis on the nose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then sung another psalm.</p>
<p class="poetry">But Louis soon was on his pins,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And used his fists a bit,<br />
But he was fairly out of breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And seldom ever hit.</p>
<p class="poetry">And at the end of round the first,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He got it fearful hot,<br />
This was his baptism of fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If we mistake it not.</p>
<p class="poetry">So Willy sent a letter home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To his mother, old Augusta,<br />
Telling her he&rsquo;d thrashed poor Lue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And given him such a duster.</p>
<p class="poetry">What wonderful events, says he,<br />
&nbsp; Has heaven brought about,<br />
I fight the greatest pugilist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That ever was brought out.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>And if by divine Providence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I get safe through this row,<br />
Then I will sing &ldquo;My God the spring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From whom all blessings flow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Meanwhile the other Monitors,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were standing looking on,<br />
But none of them durst speak a word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But all stared straight at John.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ought not I to interfere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Says Johnny to the rest,<br />
But he was told by every one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Neutrality was the best.</p>
<p class="poetry">Neutral, growl&rsquo;d John, I hate the
name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis poison to my ear,<br />
It&rsquo;s another word for cowardice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And makes me fit to swear.</p>
<p class="poetry">At any rate I can do this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My mind I will not mask,<br />
I&rsquo;ll give poor Lue a little drop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of my brandy flask.</p>
<p class="poetry">And give it up, poor Lue, my lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You might as well give in,<br />
You know that I have got no power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides you did begin.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>Then Louis rose, and looked at John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And spoke of days gone by,<br />
When he would not have seen his friend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have blackened Johnny&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">And as for giving in, friend John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort;<br />
Do you think I&rsquo;ll be a laughing stock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For everybody&rsquo;s sport.</p>
<p class="poetry">This conversation that took place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made pious Willy grin,<br />
And told John Bull to hold his noise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas nought to do with him.</p>
<p class="poetry">These words to John did make him stare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, finding to his shame,<br />
That them were worse that did look on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than them that played the game.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now Dame Europe knew the facts<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which had been going on,<br />
And with her usual dignity,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These words addressed to John:</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, Mr. Bull, pray answer me,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are you gaping here?<br />
You are my famous deputy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then why not interfere?</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>Why, answered John, and made a bow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But yet was very shy;<br />
I was told to be a neutral, ma&rsquo;am,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the reason why.</p>
<p class="poetry">That&rsquo;s just what you should not have
done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Being in authority;<br />
Did I not place you in that bunk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To think and act for me?</p>
<p class="poetry">Why any baby in the house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could not have done much worse,<br />
But I fancy you&rsquo;ve been holding back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To save your private purse.</p>
<p class="poetry">Neutrality is as fine a word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As ever a coward used,<br />
So the honour that I gave to you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You shouldn&rsquo;t have abused.</p>
<p class="poetry">The minor lodgers in the house,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On hearing this to John,<br />
Began to whisper and to laugh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And call&rsquo;d it famous fun.</p>
<p class="poetry">At last a little urchin said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Please ma&rsquo;am I&rsquo;d take my oath,<br />
At master John were neutral,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stuck up for them both.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>Stuck up for both, offended both,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that it what you mean?<br />
Continued Madame Europe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then spoke to John again:</p>
<p class="poetry">Now I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve long watch&rsquo;d your career,<br />
You take your fag&rsquo;s advice to save<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your paltry sums a year.</p>
<p class="poetry">There&rsquo;s Bob and Bill, besides some
more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I call naught but scums,<br />
They&rsquo;ve got you fairly in between<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their fingers and their thumbs.</p>
<p class="poetry">If such like men as Ben and Hugh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This day your fags had been,<br />
They would have saved both you and me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cursed disgraceful scene.</p>
<p class="poetry">And instead of being half-clad and shod,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As everybody knows,<br />
You would have dared these rivals now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To come to such like blows.</p>
<p class="poetry">There was a time in this house, John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If you put up your thumb,<br />
The greatest blackguard tongue would stop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if they had been dumb.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>But not a one i&rsquo;t house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This moment cares a fig,<br />
For all you say or all you do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Although your purse be big.</p>
<p class="poetry">I couldn&rsquo;t hurt poor Louis,
ma&rsquo;am,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he did begin;<br />
And then you see that Will and I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are very near akin.</p>
<p class="poetry">Beside, you see, said John again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I let poor Louis sup,<br />
On both I use my ointment, and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their wounds I did bind up.</p>
<p class="poetry">A weel a day then said the dame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But much affected were,<br />
I see you have some small excuse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What you have done it for.</p>
<p class="poetry">I have some little hopes left yet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That you may yet have sense,<br />
To know your high position, John,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of saving pence.</p>
<p class="poetry">You yet will learn that duty, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cannot be ignored,<br />
However disagreeable when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Placed before the board.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>And let me tell you he who shirks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The responsibility<br />
Of seeing right, is doing wrong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And deserves humility.</p>
<p class="poetry">And &rsquo;tis an empty-headed dream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To boast of skill and power,<br />
And dare not even interfere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the latest hour.</p>
<p class="poetry">Better far confess at once<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not fit for your place,<br />
Than have a name Heroic, sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Branded with disgrace.</p>
<p class="poetry">But I will not say another word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My deputies, to you;<br />
But hope you will a warning take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This moment from poor Lue.</p>
<p class="poetry">And hoping, John, your enemies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May never have the chance<br />
To see you paid for watching Will<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thrash poor weak Louis France.</p>

<p class="poetry">I left yond fields so fair to view;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I left yond mountain pass and peaks;<br />
I left two een so bonny blue,<br />

For an helmet gay and suit o&rsquo; red<br />

I mind the words the Sergeant said,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, join and be a brave dragoon:<br />

Vale of Aire.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">[It was early in the morning that I took my
ramble.&nbsp; I had noticed but little until I arrived at the
foot of the quaint old hamlet of Marley.&nbsp; My spirits began
to be cheered, for lively gratitude glowed in my heart at the
wild romantic scenery before me.&nbsp; Passing the old mansion
house, I wended my way towards the huge crag called the
&ldquo;Altar Rock.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wild and rugged as the scenery
was, it furnished an agreeable entertainment to my mind, and with
pleasure I pushed my way to the top of the gigantic rock, where I
viewed the grandeur of the vale below.&nbsp; The blossom on the
branches, the crooked Aire gliding along like sheets of polished
crystal, made me poetic.&nbsp; I thought of Nicholson, the poet
of this beautiful vale, and reclining on a green moss covered
bank, I said these words.]</p>
<p class="poetry">Poet Nicholson, old Ebor&rsquo;s darling
bard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Accept from me at least one tributary line;<br />
Yet how much more should be thy just reward,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than any wild unpolished song of mine.</p>
<p class="poetry">No monument in marble can I raise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or sculptured bust in honour of thy name;<br />
But humbly try to celebrate thy praise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And give thee that applause thou shouldst duly
claim.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>All hail, the songsters that awake the morn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And soothe the soul with wild melodious strains;<br
/>
All hail, the rocks that Bingley hills adorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath whose shades wild nature&rsquo;s grandeur
reigns.</p>
<p class="poetry">From off yon rock that rears its head so
high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And overlooks the crooked river Aire;<br />
While musing nature&rsquo;s works full meet thy eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The envied game, the lark and timid hare.</p>
<p class="poetry">In Goitstock falls, and rugged Marley hills,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Bingley&rsquo;s grand and quiet sequester&rsquo;d
dale,<br />
Each silvery stream, each dike or rippled rills,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I see thy haunt and read thy &ldquo;Poacher&rsquo;s
Tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So, Homer like, thy harp was wont to tune,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy native vale and glorious days of old,<br />
Whose maidens fair in virtuous beauty shone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sages and her heroes great and bold.</p>
<p class="poetry">No flattering baseness could employ thy
mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The free-born muse detests that servile part:<br />
In simple lore thy self-taught lay I find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More grandeur far than all the gloss of art.</p>
<p class="poetry">Though small regard be paid to worth so
rare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And humble worth unheeded pass along;<br />
Ages to come will sing the &ldquo;Vale of Aire,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Nicholson and his historic song.</p>

No, no! forbear!&mdash;yet then, yet then,<br />
&rsquo;Neath thy grim lid lie the men&mdash;<br />
Men whom fortune&rsquo;s blasted arrows hit,<br />
And send them to the pauper&rsquo;s pit.</p>
<p class="poetry">O, dig a grave somewhere for me,<br />
Deep, underneath some wither&rsquo;d tree;<br />
Or bury me on the wildest heath,<br />
Where Boreas blows his wildest breath,<br />
Or &rsquo;mid some wild romantic rocks:<br />
But, oh! forbear the pauper&rsquo;s box.</p>
<p class="poetry">Throw me into the ocean deep,<br />
Where many poor forgotten sleep;<br />
Or fling my corpse in the battle mound,<br />
With coffinless thousands &rsquo;neath the ground;<br />
I envy not the mightiest dome,<br />
But save me from a pauper&rsquo;s tomb.</p>
<p class="poetry">I care not if &rsquo;twere the wild
wolf&rsquo;s glen,<br />
Or the prison yard, with wicked men;<br />
Or into some filthy dung-hole hurled&mdash;<br />
Anywhere, anywhere! out of the world!<br />
In fire, or smoke, on land, or sea,<br />

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
